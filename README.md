# classification 

# Prediction Problem

The dataset contains images of faces with blood and faces without blood, your task is to train a model that classifies images based on the two labels.

# preprocess Images

  ->  Dimensionality reduction:Convert Image into Gray scale
  ->  Resize image: Image with Same Size
  ->  Data augmentation: Image Converted with different angle and rotation.
  
# Requirements

  -> keras
  -> numpy
  -> Tensorflow
  -> matplotlib
  -> scipy
 

 # OUTPUT
 
 We get output as a text label particular image in which classes.
