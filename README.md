# Prediction Problem

The dataset contains images of faces with blood and faces without blood, your task is to train a model that classifies images based on the two labels.

# preprocess Images

  ->  Dimensionality reduction:Convert Image into Gray scale
  ->  Resize image: Image with Same Size
  ->  Data augmentation: Image Converted with different angle and rotation.
  
# Requirements

  -> keras<br>
  -> numpy<br>
  -> Tensorflow<br>
  -> matplotlib<br>
  -> scipy<br>
  
# Layers
  -> Convolution layer<br>
  -> Pooling layer<br>
  -> Flattening<br>
  -> Fully connected layer<br>
  
# Dataset
    The folders are as follows:<br>

    1. Blood : Faces contaning blood<br>
    2. NoBlood : Faces not containing blood<br>
    3. Faces: Contains cropped images of faces <br>
 
 

 # OUTPUT
 
 We get output as a text label particular image in which classes.
